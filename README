Some snippets of code were based on the Meggy Jr. library and Peggy2 
"Game of Life" code by Windell Oskay (and others).

Uses the Peggy2 Library version 0.3b (http://code.google.com/p/peggy/).
Tested with a Peggy 2.1 with an ATMega168. Compiled using arduino-014 and all the
various goodies within.
